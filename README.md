# Transcription and translate of Opuscula´s incunabulae book with AI

Final project for the Building AI Course Project (hereinfater, Building AI CP)

## Summary

Using the Artificial Intelligence for the transcription of Opuscula, an incunabulae book safeguarded by Jagiellońska Biblioteka Cyfrowa, in order to enable the researchers to read and understand the texts contained in this book to carry out its research on and/or related to the same.

## Background

The researchers, above all dedicated to historical or documentary research, have to learn the language of incunabulae book in order to access the information contained therein. This involves studying the language in which it is written and can take years of learning. We, as specialists, have this training, but the researchers that come to our archives and libraries do not have this knowledge. For this reason, the transcription and translation of incunabulae books with AI will allow our researchers to access the understanding of the text and to better develop their research. For this project, I have selected Opuscula´s incunabulae as a prototype and model for later deployment and advancement of scientific knowledge.

## How is it used?
* Target: researchers, historians, documentary scientists, citizens
* Context: scientific research and advancement of knowledge.
* Demanded needs: reading, understanding, research development
* Challenge: transcription and translation

## Data Sources and AI methods

The first technological process is provided by the institution itself through digitization, where we get the cover, page and back cover image with its corresponding textual content. For the automatic translation, using Neural Networks. The transcription is a more complex process and, currently, the community is working with several models; hence the challenge is standardising the model. For transcription of Opuscula´s incunabulae, we need to apply Computer Vision and combination of Neural Networks.

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
